Mana is a ephemeral pseudo-particle that cannot be directly observed or interacted with. It is created solely through essence and has an extremely short half-life. Mana cannot be described as a type of matter or form of energy and has no influence over any fundamental forces or physics fields.

The key property of mana, however, is it's ability to influence quantum probability. This property can be used to convince extremely unlikely quantum events to occur by shifting and scaling the probability function of specific particles by a given amount. With enough mana particles influencing a given set of molecules, seemingly unnatural events can be observed on a macro scale.
## Overview
Mana is a ephemeral particle created by [essence](/posts/essence) for the purpose of manipulating the world in some way. This mana can then be given instructions on specific acts to perform. At a macro scale, these effects form what is colloquially referred to as magic.

At it's core, mana is simply a tool for large-scale probability manipulation. By making extremely unlikely events to occur at a quantum scale, macro scale events that occur that seem defy the logic of common physics.

As mana only correlates through an offset from standard physics via probability manipulation, the amount of mana being used allows for a more significant effect. It is far less likely that many different atoms will all perform an unlikely action, and thus more mana is required to make that event happen.

It is worth noting that the amount of mana does not guarantee that significance of the result. The quality of the instructions being provided are critical in determining how effective the result will be at achieving it's goal.
## Creation
Mana is created at a constant rate by essence. The density of the essence directly correlates with amount of mana created. Essence will always create mana at the constant rate of to one unit of mana per second per unit of essence.

Mana will always be created in the inactive state with it's attunement ratio matching the ratio of the essence creating it. For example, an individual with a 20% ice affinity, 10% earth affinity, and so on, will create mana such that 20% of all particles created have are ice attuned, while 10% of the particles are earth attuned.

Mana is created randomly, but uniformly positioned within the object that contains the essence. When actively attempting to use mana, newly created mana will always be concentrated at the point of usage within the object using the mana.

For non-physical objects, such as spirits, mana is created anywhere within the world as ambient mana and decays almost immediately unless this mana is actively being used for a specific task.
### States
Mana can be described as having two states, active and inactive. Only mana in an active state can interact with the world 

All mana particles are created in an inactive state in which they have no influence on matter or energy in any way. Within this state, they has an extremely short half-life and quickly decay into nothing. This is often referred to as the "storage" state, as long-term storage of mana is only possible in this state by having it occupy the space inside specific crystals. (See [storage](#storage]))

Once a mana particle is given a set of instructions, either through essence or another mana particle influencing it, it will move into an active state. In this state, the mana particle will proceed to immediately execute its given instructions, destroying itself in the process. These instructions may be overridden by other mana particles, but cannot be removed once provided.
### Storage
Mana can only be stored long term within a crystal without it immediately starting to decay. While active mana will not decay until it has completed it's given instruction set, it cannot be stored in any way during this state. Inactive mana, on the other hand, will decay within seconds but can be placed within a crystal to drastically increase it's half life. The duration of storage depends on the type of crystal and attunement of the mana.

While the size of a crystal does not effect it's storage duration, it does determine the quantity of mana that can be stored within. If more mana particles are stored within a crystal than it's size would allow, the additional mana particles will continue decay at a standard rate despite still being within the crystal.

All mana within the crystal will naturally spread out into an even density throughout the crystal. The speed at which this diffusion occurs depends on the type and purity of the crystal. When crystals with a low mana conductivity have a high rate of mana being inserted, mana density may build up too quickly in a single area, causing that area of the crystal to become full before the rest of the crystal and leading to mana loss through natural decay.

It is highly recommending to have multiple points of insertion around the crystal when channeling have rates of mana into a crystal with low conductivity.
## Attunement
All mana is created with a specific attunement. This natural attunement of the mana acts as a sort of collection of pre-existing instructions that the mana can follow. Mana of a specific attunement is capable of being converted from one type of attunement to another by essence, by the rate of conversion is greatly dependent on the affinity of the essence.
## Mana Friction
Mana friction is the emergence of minor side-effects that occur when moving around large amounts of mana. As mana is being moved, a small portion of this mana is sometimes activated too early or on the wrong target, leading to common side effects. 

These effects most often include, but are not limited to:
- Glowing
- Darkness
- Vibrations
- Sounds
- Heating
- Cooling
- Uneasy Feeling
- Alluring Feeling
- etc

The type of effects that may occur depend completely on the attunement of the mana being used.

This mana friction can be seen most frequently in active spells being cast, enchanted items, runes, and spell circles. It is through the use of mana friction that individuals without a dedicated mana perception ability are capable of observing active mana and spells. An enchanted item or magical material will almost always provide enough mana friction to inform individuals of the significance of the item.

Mana friction can also be observed within high level individuals as mana is created and moved around through their body. This natural movement and friction is often referred to as a person's aura, and is an easy, yet unreliable, method of estimating the level of a target.
