Mana is a ephemeral pseudo-particle that cannot be directly observed or interacted with. It is created solely through essence and has an extremely short half-life. Mana cannot be described as a type of matter or form of energy and has no influence over any fundamental forces or physics fields.

The key property of mana, however, is it's ability to influence quantum probability. This property can be used to convince extremely unlikely quantum events to occur by shifting and scaling the probability function of specific particles by a given amount. With enough mana particles influencing a given set of molecules, seemingly unnatural events can be observed on a macro scale.
## Overview
### States
Mana can be described as having two states, active and inactive. Only mana in an active state can interact with the world 

All mana particles are created in an inactive state in which they have no influence on matter or energy in any way. Within this state, they has an extremely short half-life and quickly decay into nothing. This is often referred to as the "storage" state, as long-term storage of mana is only possible in this state by having it occupy the space inside specific materials, such as crystals or certain metals.

Once a mana particle is given a set of instructions, either through essence or another mana particle influencing it, it will move into an active state. In this state, the mana particle will proceed to immediately execute its given instructions, destroying itself in the process. These instructions may be overridden by other mana particles, but cannot be removed once provided.
